# 🏡 House Price Prediction using R

This project predicts house prices using regression tree models in R, emphasizing model interpretability and performance.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To estimate housing prices based on key property features using regression trees, and evaluate the effectiveness of model-driven pricing predictions.

---

## 📊 Methodology

- Cleaned and prepared data from a real estate dataset (or `ISLR2`)
- Built regression trees using `rpart`
- Pruned tree for better generalization
- Evaluated performance using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Visualized tree splits to understand key predictors like lot size and square footage

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `R`, `RStudio`
- `rpart`, `rpart.plot`, `ISLR2`
- `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`
